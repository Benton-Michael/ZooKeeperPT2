# ZooKeeperPT2
Addition of the BigBadBat class and methods using inheritance

The zoo keeper was happy with the work you did and now wants some more help, they have captured a rare specimen. Its default energy is much higher than most mammals, its energy level is 300. It also can do a lot more than climb - it can fly. Moreover, this specimen doesn't eat bananas, it eats humans... and it doesn't throw things, but attacks towns. The zoo keeper has caught a giant Bat and wants your help to track its energy levels.

The bat should be tested by attacking three towns, eating two humans, flying twice, and then displaying its energy. Use the display energy from the superclass!

Objectives:
Implement packages to namespace your project.
